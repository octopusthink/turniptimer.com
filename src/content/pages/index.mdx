Turnip is an unobtrusive timer app designed for busy freelancers who need to get things done. We're freelancers ourselves, so we know how valuable your time is. We built Turnip to give you what you need to do your work, and then get out of your way.

Turnip is currently available for Mac and Windows. It offers both a standalone version and a FreeAgent integration. (We plan to offer more integrations in the future—drop us a line if you have an integration you'd like us to offer!)

Beta testers will receive free updates to the app for the duration of the beta period. Once the app is released, all beta testers will also receive a free premium subscription for a year, plus discounted subscription thereafter, along with our infinite gratitude. ❤️
