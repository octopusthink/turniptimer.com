## Time tracking made easy.

If you're a freelancer, you know that your **time really _does_ equal money**. So tracking the time you spend on a task is absolutely critical to your business.

We know this, because [we're freelancers too](https://octopusthink.com). We built Turnip because we needed a timer app that was simple and flexible. A timer app that gives you what you need to do your work—and then **gets out of your way**.
