If you're a freelancer, you know that your time really _does_ equal money. So tracking the time you spend on a task is absolutely critical to your business.

We know this, because [we're freelancers too](https://octopusthink.com). We built Turnip because we needed a timer app that was simple and flexible. A timer app that gives you what you need to do your work‚Äîand then gets out of your way.

We use Turnip every day, and we ‚ù§Ô∏è it. We hope you will, too.

## What's Turnip?

Turnip is a timer tracking app for your menu bar (if you're a Mac) or system tray (if you're a PC). It offers both a standalone version and a [FreeAgent](https://freeagent.com) integration.

- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Pause, start, and add new timers from your menu bar.
- üóÇ Attach timers to tasks, projects, and clients.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edit & round time on the fly.
- üìä Understand how you spend your time.

We plan to offer more integrations in the future. Drop us a line if you have an integration you'd like us to offer!
