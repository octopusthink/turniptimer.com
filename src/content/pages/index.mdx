## Time tracking made **easy**.

When you’re a freelancer, **time really does equal money**. Tracking the time you spend on a task is critical to your business.

We know this, because we’re freelancers too. We built Turnip because we needed a simple, elegant timer app that gives you what you need to do your work—and then gets **out of your way**.

## Work **smarter**, not harder.

Where _does_ the time go? Turnip uses statistics and charts to help you understand how you’re spending your time. Keep tabs on your time and take breaks to avoid burnout.

## Always by your **side**.

Turnip sits in your menu bar, so you’ll always know at a glance if your timer is running. You can switch tasks, edit your time, start a new timer, or access statistics—all without leaving what you’re currently working on.

## Integrate with **your tools**.

Spend more time working and less time on adminstrative work by integrating directly with your accounting system.

Turnip currently works on its own or with FreeAgent. We're working on adding more integrations for the release.
