# Privacy policy

Turnip is a simple timer app made by Sarah &amp; Matt at [Octopus Think](https://octopusthink.com/about).

By default, Turnip collects **absolutely no data** about you, your computer, or your usage of the app.

## Beta programme

If you sign up for the Turnip beta, crash reporting and analytics are mandatory. This is to ensure that we know if anything is going wrong. Your data is anonymised and isn‚Äôt tied to any personal identifier in any way. If that makes you uncomfortable, we totally understand, but we think this is the best way to ensure that we can improve the app for our beta users as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Integrations

Turnip connects to your third-party services using secure authentication tokens provided by the third-party service. We don't store, collect, or even see your password or login credentials for any third-party service. 

## Crash reports and usage statistics

**Analytics are completely optional and opt-in.** We'll never sell your information to advertisers, third-parties, or that kid who was mean to you in first grade. If you opt into analytics, we'll always ensure that your data is anonymised and kept secure.

If you do choose to opt into our analytics, here's what we collect:
- Anonymous usage statistics‚Äîstuff like what integrations you use, how many tags you use for a timeslip, and the number of times you interact with the app.
- Your country and OS language.
- The version number of Turnip you're using.
- Crash logs and info about audio devices connected to your Mac.
- The type of Mac you have and the version of macOS you're running.

If you opt-in, usage data is uploaded to our Firebase Analytics account and crash reports are uploaded to our Sentry account. This data contains no personally identifiable information about you or your usage of Turnip.

## Billing information

We don't collect, store, or process your billing information and we don't have access to your credit card information. If you purchase a subscription, Apple processes your payment info.

## Contact information

By default, we don't have access to your contact information or any other personal identifier. 

If you sign up for our newsletter or beta programme, we'll have access to your email address. This information will be retained until you unsubscribe or the mailing list hasn't been used for a period of three years. You can unsubscribe at any point.

If you contact us with a support request, we'll have access to your email address, name, and any other identifiers included in your email. This information will be stored for as long as we are actively continuing to work on the app. 

## Managing your data

If you'd like us to remove all of your personal data from our system, or if you'd like a copy of the data we have about you, please contact us at hello@octopusthink.com. 

Since we're a small two-person company, this is a manual process, but we'll do our best to get it sorted within a week. 

## Newsletters

When you sign up for our beta programme or newsletter, we store your information with Buttondown, a privacy-conscious newsletter provider. We don't track opens, clicks, or anything else beyond when you subscribed and when you unsubscribe. If you unsubscribe your data is retained on Buttondown in accordance with their [privacy policy](https://docs.buttondown.email/odds-and-ends/privacy-and-security) unless you request that we delete your information.

## Cookies on this website

We don't use any cookies on this website. üç™

## Our stance on privacy

Your data is _yours_. We **only collect data you agree to share**. You can opt out at any time. Nothing we collect can identify you personally, either by way of a unique ID or by your usage patterns. We're not interested in spying on you. üôà
