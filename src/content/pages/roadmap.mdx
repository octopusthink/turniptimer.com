During our beta period, we'll be releasing new features as quickly as we can. If there's something you'd love to see in Turnip, drop us a line ([turnip@octopusthink.com](mailto: turnip@octopusthink.com)) and let us know! We love hearing your feedback.

Here's what's next on our radar:
- A stats panel, so you can see a breakdown of how you're spending your time. (In progress)
- A screen to show you a detailed breadown of all your timeslips.
- More integrations: FreshBooks, Xero, Wave, Harvest, Tick. (Let us know if there's an integration you'd love!)
- Colour-coding tags
- UI and UX improvements (Vague, but true)
